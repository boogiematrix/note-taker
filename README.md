  ## Description
  This is a note taking application that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and saves to and retrieves data from a JSON file.  Write your note title and text then click the save icon in the upper right to save your note. You can retrieve the note by clicking on the title's text in the left column, or delete it by clicking the trash can icon associated with each note.
